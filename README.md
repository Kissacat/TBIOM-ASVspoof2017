# TBIOM-ASVspoof2017
This repository contains code used in our recent research work [1] on the ASVspoof 2017 version 2.0 replay spoofing dataset. In this work we aim to understand the ASVspoof 2017 version 2.0 dataset, various artefacts in this dataset and their impact on countermeasure models. This article has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Biometrics, Behavior, and Identity Science (T-BIOM), 2020.
